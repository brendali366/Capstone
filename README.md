MOBILE MINDS

Learning Kids is an engaging mobile game and learning application designed to aid K-12 children that have been diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and slow-learners in learning important contact information in the case of an emergency. The application will allow parents/guardians to upload their own contact information into the integrated contact book such as name, phone number, and a picture for their child to memorize their contact information. The learning activity will be in the form of a story game to keep our users engaged and allow them to learn the contact information integrated into the game from the contact book feature. There will also be a leaderboard feature so that users can see how their story game score ranks against other users as well
